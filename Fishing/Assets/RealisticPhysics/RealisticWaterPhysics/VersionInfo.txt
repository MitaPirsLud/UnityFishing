Realistic Water Physics

Current version: 2.2
Last update: 9/4/16
Tested it on unity version: 5.4.0f3 Personal.

Version 2.2.1 (Hotfix)
[Bugs]
(-) Removed bug where water level option was not saved!

Version 2.2:
[General]
(^) The ExternalWaterLevelManager can now be found as a component at "RealisticPhysics/RealisticWaterPhysics/ExternalWaterLevelManager"
(+) Added public call on RealisticBouyancy, isInWater() will return true if any of the checking points are hitting the water.
(^) Fixed some issues with the volume calculations, its still not perfect is some situations. Its still the best with a mesh or box collider and mesh filter!
(+) improved some code to handle more items at once.
(+) Added RealisticRiverFlow script and can be found at "RealisticPhysics/RealisticWaterPhysics/RealisticRiverFlow"

[Window]
(+) Added a small logo
(^) Fixed small issue of Floating quallity not updating correctly when importing data from existing gameobject.
(^) Fixed issues where enableing support not always works.
(^) Fixed water level not updating correctly on some settings.
(^) Fixed some text showing incorrectly.

[RealisticBouyancy script]
(+) Added bit of code so objects that have the RigedBody isKinematic set to true will not run the buoyancy script.
(+) Added better support for other systems.
(^) Fixed and improved a few things
(+) Added new script interface for a nicer look.

[Support]
(+) Added AQUAS Water Lite support
(+) Added AQUAS Water/River Set support
(+) Added PlayWay Water System Support
(+) Added Dynamic Water System support

[Bugs]
(+) Disable and reinable a collider on start() will stop the setup and show incorrect behavior
(+) Does not always work on a model where its point of center is not inside its model.
(+) Scaling objects in-run time even with heavy edits on will not work right.



Version 2.1:

[General]
(^) Moved folder to "RealisticPhysics/RealisticWaterPhysics"
(^) the ExternalWaterLevelManager can now be found as a component at "RealisticWater/RealisticWaterPhysics/ExternalWaterLevelManager"
(^) Fixed Volume calculation bug.
(+) Fixed manager from resetting if there are 2 scenes loaded into one.

[RealisticBouyancy script]
(^) Fixed bug where objects without meshfilters where not calculated correctly.
(+) Added movePosition() works the same as RigidBody.movePosition, only it will not flip the object over.
(+) Code cleanup

[manager Window]
(^) Fixed bug where water level did not update if window was closed, if water level was set as game object.



Version 2.0:

[Tested]
(+) Tested on Windows 7 PC
(+) Tested on Web Player
(+) Tested on Xbox One

[General]
(+) Contains 16 Liquid Materials.
(+) Contains 22 Gas Materials.
(+) Contains 55 Solid Materials.
(+) All changes in the windows at runtime will now be saved if you stop runtime.
(+) All changes in the window to a object will now we instantly applyed, but not saved after you stop runtime!
(+) Added a 'Show advanced options/info' button.

[setup]
(+) You can now use all Liquid Materials as water.
(+) You can now use all Gas Materials as Air.
(+) You can set the water level to be a gameobject, and this will update in runtime.
(+) You can now see the density of water and air in the window.
(+) Added option to use external water management.

[setup GameObjects]
(-) removed the select gameobject option.
(+) Added option to click them from the hierarchy, or project.
(+) Aded multi-object select support!
(+) Added Floating Quality option
(+) Added advanced option to select material Type (Liquid, Gas or Solid)
(-) Removed Terminal velocity option, cause issue with the physics engine.

[Manage gameObjects]
(+) Same as the setup, but will automaticly search trough your hierarchy to filter out gameobjects with a existing setup.

[RealisticBouyancy script]
(-) Removed a lot of useless code.
(+) Added option 'Light Run Time Edits' This allows you to edit the setting while in runtime.
(+) Added option 'Light Run Time Edits' This allows you to edit all the setting while in runtime.
(+) Added some public functions for you to use, to change the object at runetime.
(+) Improved intire system it will now run the script in just 0.00001 second, and no GarbageCollection anymore!

[other]
(+)Extra check if Ceto Ocean system is enabled but ocean not found. This will make the object state 'disabled'
	And the following message will be displayed: '[Realistic Water Physics] Ceto support enabled but missing Ocean!'
(+)Changed the layout of the setup window, added more info.
(+)Window will now repaint 10 times a second to keep the info up-to-date
(+)Added new unit of Tempeture! you can now use Celsius or Fahrenheit, the window will calculate it for you.
(+)Added a check if mesh is there or not, if not it will be using a collider to calculate its volume, it that is also not found the system can not work and a message will show:
	'There is no MeshFilter or Collider on this object!'
(+)Improved the speed of the script.
(+)Added check to see if the selected object was created with advanced options enabled, toggling it on if so.
(-)Removed the option to set water/air Tempeture!, the changes will be so small
(+)Added check to see if the manager contains the script, if not it will stop the window and report errors.
(+)Added support for DynamicWaterSystem Same setup as for Ceto, but add DW to the 'Scriping Define Symbols'
	This suport will allow you to use Realistic water Physics as a base, and have the buoyancy be handeld by the DynamicWaterSystem 
	(Note: Its still in development!)

[Examples]
(+) Added the 'ExternalWaterLevelManager' example script
	This allows you to have some basic moving water.
=============================================================================================
Known issues:
(+)changing the settings on a objects using the manager thats also a prefab will not overwrite prefab settins.
	You need to break the instance!
(+)Hiding the advanced settings sometimes ignores later changes on some settings.
=============================================================================================

Version 2.3 Plans:
- Better material management.
- Aquas support comming soon!
